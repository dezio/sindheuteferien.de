            <p>The following information provides a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit
                this website. Personal data includes all data that can be used to personally identify you. Detailed
                information on data protection can be found in our privacy policy listed below this text.</p>
            <h3>Data Collection on This Website</h3>
            <h4>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</h4>

            <p>Other data is collected automatically or with your consent when you visit the website through our IT
                systems. This mainly includes technical data (e.g., internet browser, operating system, or the time of
                the page visit). The collection of these data occurs automatically as soon as you enter this
                website.</p>
            <h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>
            <p>A part of the data is collected to ensure the error-free provision of the website. Other data may be used
                to analyze your user behavior.</p>
            <h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>
            <p>You have the right at any time to receive free information about the origin, recipient, and purpose of
                your stored personal data. You also have the right to request correction or deletion of this data. If
                you have given consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any time for the future.

            <h2>2. General Notices and Mandatory Information</h2>
            <h3>Data Protection</h3>
            <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your
                personal data confidentially and in accordance with legal data protection regulations and this privacy
                policy.</p>
            <p>If you use this website, various personal data will be collected. Personal data is data that can be used
                to personally identify you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and for what purposes. It
                also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
            <p>We point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication via email) may have security
                gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
            <h3>Note on the Responsible Entity</h3>
            <p>The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:</p>
            <p>Tiziano Santo Metzler<br>
                Bautzener Allee 59<br>
                02977 Hoyerswerda<br>
                Germany</p>

            <p>Phone: +4915901084284<br>
                Email: hoy-metzler-it@fn.de
            </p>
            <p>The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the
                purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

            <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
            <p>Unless a specific storage period is stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain
                with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate deletion
                request or withdraw your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other
                legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods);
                in the latter case, deletion will occur after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
            <h3>General Information on Legal Bases of Data Processing on This Website</h3>
            <p>If you have given consent to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or
                Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of data are processed under Art. 9(1) GDPR. In case of explicit
                consent for transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing also occurs based on Art.
                49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device
                (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing additionally takes place based on § 25(1) TTDSG.
                Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for contract fulfillment or
                pre-contractual measures, we process it based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if
                necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also occur based
                on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Details on the relevant legal bases are
                provided in the following sections of this privacy policy.</p>
            <h3>Revocation of Consent to Data Processing</h3>
            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke a previously
                given consent at any time. The legality of data processing carried out before the revocation remains
                unaffected.</p>
            <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Specific Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
            <p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(e) OR (f) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME, FOR REASONS
                ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO
                APPLIES TO PROFILEING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. The respective legal basis, from which the data
                processing is derived, is to be taken from this privacy policy. If you file an objection, we will no
                longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
                processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or if the processing serves to assert,
                exercise, or defend legal claims (objection under Art. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
            <p>If your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right at any time to
                object to processing of your personal data for such advertising; this also applies to profiling related
                to such direct marketing. If you object, your personal data will no longer be used for direct marketing
                (objection under Art. 21(2) GDPR).</p>
            <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority</h3>
            <p>In case of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
                authority, especially in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the
                alleged violation. The right to complain exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial
                remedies.</p>
            <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
            <p>You have the right to receive data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract,
                automatically, in a common machine-readable format, or to have it transmitted to a third party. If you
                request direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent
                technically feasible.</p>
            <h3>Access, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
            <p>Within the scope of applicable legal regulations, you have the right at any time to free information
                about your stored personal data, its origin, recipient, and the purpose of processing, and, if
                applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time regarding
                this and other questions about personal data.</p>
            <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of processing your personal data. You can contact us at any
                time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we generally need time to verify
                    this. During the verification period, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of
                    your personal data.
                </li>
                <li>If the processing of your personal data was unlawful, you can oppose deletion and instead request
                    restriction of use.
                </li>
                <li>If we no longer need your personal data but you need it to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims,
                    you have the right to request restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
                </li>
                <li>If you have objected under Art. 21(1) GDPR, a decision must be made whether our interests outweigh
                    yours. Until it is clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request restriction of
                    processing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have requested the restriction of your personal data, these data – aside from their storage – may
                only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or to
                protect the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of an important public interest of
                the Union or a member state.</p>
            <h3>SSL/TLS Encryption</h3>
            <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
                content, such as orders or inquiries you send us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted
                connection in the browser address bar by the change from "http://" to "https://" and the padlock symbol
                in your browser line.</p>
            <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
            <h3>Objection to Advertising Emails</h3>
            <p>The use of contact data published in the context of imprint obligations for sending unsolicited
                advertising and information materials is hereby expressly contradicted. The operators of these pages
                reserve the right to take legal action in case of unsolicited advertising, such as spam emails.</p>
            <h2>3. Data Collection on This Website</h2>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Our websites use so-called "cookies." Cookies are small data packages that do no harm to your device.
                They are either temporarily stored for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently stored
                on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit ends.
                Permanent cookies remain on your device until you delete them yourself or your browser does so
                automatically.</p>
            <p>Cookies can originate from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party providers (third-party cookies).
                Third-party cookies allow the integration of certain services from third parties within web pages (e.g.,
                cookies for processing payment services).</p>
            <p>Cookies serve various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary because certain website functions
                would not work without them (e.g., shopping cart function or video display). Other cookies can be used
                for evaluating user behavior or for advertising purposes.</p>
            <p>Cookies used to carry out electronic communication processes, provide certain functions you desire (e.g.,
                shopping cart function), or optimize the website (e.g., measurement cookies for web audience) (necessary
                cookies) are stored based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, provided no other legal basis is specified. The website
                operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies to ensure the technically error-free and
                optimized provision of its services. If consent was obtained for storing cookies and similar
                technologies, processing occurs solely based on this consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG);
                consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
            <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about cookies being set and to allow cookies only in
                individual cases, to accept cookies for certain cases, or to generally exclude cookies, and to activate
                automatic cookie deletion when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of
                this website.</p>
            <p>You can see which cookies and services are used on this website in this privacy policy.</p>
            <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
            <p>The provider of these pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files,
                which your browser automatically transmits to us. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browser type and version</li>
                <li>Used operating system</li>
                <li>Referrer URL</li>
                <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
                <li>Time of the server request</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is not combined with other data sources.</p>
            <p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest
                in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of their website – to this end, server log
                files must be collected.</p>
            <h3>Inquiry by Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
            <p>If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your request, including all personal data (name, request)
                provided to us for processing your inquiry, will be stored and processed by us. We do not disclose this
                data without your consent.</p>
            <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry relates to the fulfillment of a
                contract or is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is
                based on our legitimate interest in effectively processing inquiries received (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or
                your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR), if obtained; consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
            <p>The data you send to us via contact forms remains with us until you request its deletion, revoke your
                consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after the completion of
                your request). Mandatory legal provisions – especially statutory retention periods – remain
                unaffected.</p>
